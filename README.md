# Crypto Asset-Swap Bot

This app (under very recent development) will be used to assist you in
knowing when to exchange one crypto asset for another.  We all like to
wait around for the next big opportunity to swap, but it's nice to have
a set of eye around-the-clock for you.

More to come in the near future!

## Notes for Mac OS 11

To install Twilio, unlike the normal:
```shell
pip install twilio
```

that we all grew to know and love, now, Mac OS X and OS 11 users will
now have to run:

```shell
brew tap twilio/brew && brew install twilio
```

I know.  It's a pain in the ass, but what are you going to do?  Stay tuned
for more updates...
